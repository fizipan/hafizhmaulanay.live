Show data with the default properties you want, not only that. Scope can also help us in making our code more readable.

Before we start, I will first show you the difference between before and after.

```php
// Before
Article::where('user_id', $request->user())->where('status', ArticleStatus::PUBLISHED)->get();

// After
Article::query()->wherePublishedAndBelongsToMe()->get();
```

Since I am modelling with an article, we will assume that there is a status on the article. Like for example `unpublished` and `published`. So if you look at the example above, it just uses an enum from PHP. More or less the enum is like this.

```php
enum ArticleStatus: int
{
    case UNPUBLISHED = 0;
    case PREVIEW = 1;
    case PUBLISHED = 2;
}
```

Now, open the article model and add 3 methods in it with `scopeNameOfFunction` prefix like:

```php
use App\Enums\ArticleStatus;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Database\Query\Builder;
class Article extends Model
{
//...
public function scopeWherePublished(Builder $builder)
{
return $builder->where('status', ArticleStatus::PUBLISHED);
}

    public function scopeWhereBelongsToMe(Builder $builder)
    {
        return $builder->whereBelongsTo(auth()?->user());
    }

    public function scopeWherePublishedAndBelongsToMe(Builder $builder)
    {
        return $builder->wherePublished()->whereBelongsToMe();
    }

}

```

After that, you can use it like the example above, only for the `scopeWhereBelongsToMe` method there is a little exception. Make sure if you want to use it it is right on the page that has been protected by `middleware auth`. That's just an example, of course you can create whatever you want.

Well for how to use it it's very easy, if we need one that only has `published` status, then we can do it like:

```php
Article::query()->wherePublished()->get();
```

And if you want to display everything related to the logged in user and don't care about the status, you can do it like:

```php
Article::query()->whereBelongsToMe()->get();
```

And of course, if you want both, it would be like:

```php
Article::query()->whereBelongsToMe()->wherePublished()->get();
```

Or put together with the prefix `and` like:

```php
Article::query()->wherePublishedAndBelongsToMe()->get();
```

More or less for such `scope` usage. But the scope we did above is still called local scope. Why is that? Because there is actually a way to scope globally. So the scope is applied by default.

### Global Scope

Now we will give you an example. Open your terminal and run the artisan command to create a scope like:

```bash
php artisan make:scope PublishedScope
```

After that, it will create us a folder `Scopes` with the file `ArticleScope.php` inside. Look for the file right inside the `app/Models/Scopes/ArticleScope.php` directory. Remember, that this class only contains one method, `apply`, so if you try to create one more method under it, it will error. Because this class itself is implemented with `interface Scope` which contains only 1 method like:

```php
public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model);
```

Now, you can enter the query you want to create right into that `apply` method like:

```php
class PublishedScope implements Scope
{
    public function apply(Builder $builder, Model $model)
    {
        return $builder->where('status', ArticleStatus::PUBLISHED)->latest();
    }
}
```

Next you can register that scope globally right on the model that needs it.

```php
class Article extends Model
{
    /**
     * The "booted" method of the model.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope(new PublishedScope);
    }
}
```

If the user model also needs that scope, then you can also stick it in there like:

```php
class User extends Model
{
    /**
     * The "booted" method of the model.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope(new PublishedScope);
    }
}
```

### Anonymous Global Scopes

If you don't want to create it outside of the model, you can use an _anonymous global scope_ like:

```php
class User extends Model
{
    protected static function booted()
    {
        static::addGlobalScope('published', function (Builder $builder) {
            $builder->where('status', Article::PUBLISHED);
        });
    }
}

```

### Without Global Scope

Sometimes we don't want to use this scope, for example we want to display all articles regardless of their status. Then it can be prevented by adding a `withoutGlobalScope` method such as:

```php
Article::withoutGlobalScope(PublishedScope::class)->get();
```

Or if you are using an _anonymous global scope_ you can directly enter the name like:

```php
Article::withoutGlobalScope('published')->get();
```

Hope this article is useful. Until next time 👋🏻
